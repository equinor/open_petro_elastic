"""
Calculations derived from the usual equation for estimating primary
and secondary wave velocities in isotropic media:

Vp = sqrt((K+(4/3)u) / rho)

and

Vs = sqrt(u/rho)

where

  * Vp is the velocity of the primary (compressional) wave
  * Vs is the velocity of the secondary (shear) wave
  * K is the bulk moduli
  * u is the shear moduli
